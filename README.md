## About this Project
This project was designed as an introduction into form validation utilising CSS and basic JavaScript. It is currently uncomplete and requires polishing to make it responsive and more accessible. It was simply done as a means of increasing my knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and front-end web development.
